# Usage

For this application, I used [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com) for help styling the application.

The weather data was taken from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) API. Specifically the "One Call", and the "Current Weather Data" APIs

I did most of my work in the development branch. I will be cleaning and deleting all comments on the main branch, and using the develop branch as a reference notebook.
